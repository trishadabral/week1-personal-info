# 🎓 Student Grade Calculator

## 📌 Project Description
The Student Grade Calculator is a Python-based console application that processes
multiple students’ marks, calculates grades with personalized comments, and
generates class-level statistics.

This project is designed to strengthen core Python programming concepts such as
conditional statements, loops, lists, functions, error handling, and file handling.
